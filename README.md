Accessible Travel Guide Website
Overview
I created the Accessible Travel Guide website to make travel planning more accessible and transparent for individuals with disabilities. My focus is on supporting those with hearing, visual, and mobility impairments. The website provides detailed information on various destinations, accommodation options, transportation modes, and accessible services.

Features
Accessibility Ratings
On my platform, users can provide feedback on different aspects of their travel experience. Each service, such as airlines or hotels, can be rated on a scale from 1 to 100 based on visual, hearing, and mobility accessibility. For example, a user might rate Delta Airlines as 40% mobility accessible. Subsequent user ratings are averaged to update the service's accessibility score on its dedicated page, helping future travelers make informed decisions.

Expense-O-Meter
I included an "expense-o-meter" feature that allows users to gauge the cost aspect of their travel choices alongside accessibility considerations.

User Comments
Travelers can leave detailed comments about their experiences, providing further context and guidance for others.

Travel Itinerary Builder
The website allows users to construct their own travel itineraries by selecting destinations, modes of transportation, accommodations, and services. This feature helps users tailor their travel plans according to their accessibility needs.

Incomplete Features
Overall Trip Accessibility Calculation
One feature I intended to implement but did not complete would have allowed for the calculation of overall trip accessibility. This would average the accessibility scores of all selected components (e.g., airlines, hotels, and destinations) to provide a composite accessibility rating for the entire trip.

Accessibility Ranking System
Another feature I was unable to finalize would have enabled the website to rank the items on each page according to their accessibility in a chosen category, such as visual or mobility accessibility. This would have helped users easily identify the most suitable options.
